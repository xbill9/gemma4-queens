"""Context x output-length sweep against a running OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

    python3 sweep.py --base http://<ip>:8000/v1 --out benchmarks/runs/<run>/

Lives at the rig root, NOT inside a run directory. The JAX sibling kept its
sweep inside `benchmarks/runs/<run>/` and copy-pasted it per run, so every
iteration re-derived its own harness and two numbers that were supposed to be
comparable had two sources of drift. One harness, many runs.

Three things it is opinionated about, each because it has cost a measurement
somewhere in this family:

* **Warm at the shape you measure.** The sibling recorded a 4x error from
  warming at one max_tokens and measuring at another. Cheap insurance even here,
  where nothing is compiled: cuBLAS autotune and allocator growth are per-shape.
* **Median, not mean.** A spot host gives the occasional slow request, and the
  cold/warm gap is several-fold.
* **Quote decode, not end-to-end.** Decode times the token loop alone; the
  end-to-end rate carries prefill and the HTTP round trip. Both are recorded,
  and they will not agree -- by up to 41% on a long-context row.

## Why there are two decode sources

`usage.decode_tokens_per_second` is a field OUR servers invent. vLLM does not
emit it, and neither does anything else -- so until 2026-08-31 this harness
structurally could not measure the vLLM sibling, and the three-rig comparison
was three harnesses computing three statistics. Re-running a rig does not fix
that; only a common statistic does.

The common statistic is **client-side inter-token latency off the SSE stream**,
which every OpenAI-compatible server provides. `--decode-source` selects it:

* `usage`  -- the server's own decode gauge. Excludes HTTP entirely; the number
              every report in this family before 2026-08-31 quotes.
* `stream` -- (output_tokens - 1) / (t_last_token - t_first_token) from the
              stream. **Deliberately identical to `vllm bench serve`'s TPOT**,
              which is `(latency - ttft) / (output_len - 1)`, so a number from
              here is directly comparable to that tool's published figures.
* `both`   -- both, per repeat, at the cost of two requests instead of one.
              `usage` stays primary so older runs remain comparable, and the
              ratio between them is recorded as `stream_over_usage`.
* `auto`   -- (default) probe the endpoint once: `both` where the server emits
              the gauge, `stream` where it does not.

**`stream` reads slightly LOW against `usage` by construction** -- it carries
per-token SSE framing and a socket read that the server-side gauge does not.
That is the point of `both`: it measures the offset rather than assuming it.

One assumption the stream path makes, stated because it is not universal: **one
content delta per chunk**. True for this rig, the JAX sibling and vLLM's default
chat stream. A server that batches deltas would understate token count, so the
recorded `stream_chunks` is cross-checked against `usage.completion_tokens`
whenever the stream carries a usage block.
