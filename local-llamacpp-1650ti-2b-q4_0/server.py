"""Local llama.cpp lifecycle and inference MCP server — GTX 1650 Ti, Gemma 4 E2B q4_0.

THIS IS THE FIRST `local` RIG IN THE TREE, and the shape of it is different from
every sibling in one way that matters more than any of the code below: there is
no control plane. The card is in the machine. Nothing here provisions capacity,
waits for it, discovers an endpoint, or releases anything.

So the tools that dominate a sibling's server.py — find_tpu, create_*_queued_resource,
manage_queued_resource, the zone-status skip list — have no analogue and are
deliberately absent. If a `find_*` tool ever appears in this file, the rig has the
wrong name (NAMING.md, "`local` is the absence of a control plane").

What is left is the half that is actually the same everywhere: start the model
server, check it, ask it something, and report what the hardware is doing.

MEMORY, BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY REAL CONSTRAINT HERE: the artifact is 3.35 GB on
disk but only ~1.31 GiB has to be resident, because per_layer_token_embd (1.93 GB,
58% of the file) is created with TENSOR_READ_LAZY in llama.cpp's
src/models/gemma4.cpp and served by GET_ROWS out of the mmap. Full offload fits a
4 GiB card with ~2.3 GiB to spare. Do not "fix" a memory worry by lowering
N_GPU_LAYERS or passing --no-mmap; the second one breaks the mechanism outright.
See CLAUDE.md.

STATUS 2026-09-03: NOTHING HAS BEEN SERVED. llama.cpp is built at 95ef7fc and the
model file is on disk; no token has been generated through this server.
